27. Why there are no pointers in
Java?
In Java there are references instead of pointers. These references
point to objects in memory. But there is no direct access to these
memory locations. JVM is free to move the objects within VM
memory.
The absence of pointers helps Java in managing memory and
garbage collection effectively. Also it provides developers with
convenience of not getting worried about memory allocation and deallocation.
