26. How aggregation and composition
are different concepts?
In OOPS, Aggregation and Composition are the types of association
relations. A composition is a strong relationship. If the composite
object is destroyed, then all its parts are destroyed. E.g. A Car has a
Steering Wheel. If Car object is destroyed, then there is no meaning
of Steering Wheel.
In Aggregation, the relationship is weaker than Composition.
E.g. A Library has students. If a Library is destroyed, Students still
exist. So Library and Student are related by Aggregation. A Library
has Books. If Library is destroyed, the Books are also destroyed.
Books of a Library cannot exist without the Library. So Book and
Library are related by Composition.
