22. Explain the concept of
Inheritance?
Inheritance is an important concept in Object Oriented
Programming. Some objects share certain characteristics and
behavior. By using Inheritance, we can put the common behavior
and characteristics in a base class which also known as super class.
And then all the objects with common behavior inherit from this
base class.
It is also represented by IS-A relationship.
Inheritance promotes, code reuse, method overriding and polymorphism.
