33. Why it is not a good practice to
create static variables in Java?
Static variables are common to all the objects of a class. If a new
object is created, there is no need to test the value of static variable.
Any code that uses static variable can be in any state. It can be
within a new object or at a class level. So the scope of static
variable is open ended in a Java class.
If we want tighter control on scope, then variables should be
created at the object creation level.
Also defining static variables is not a good practice because they go
against the principles of Object Oriented Programming.
