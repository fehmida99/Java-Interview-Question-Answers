7. How does ClassLoader work in
Java?
In Java, ClassLoader is a class that is used to load files in JVM.
ClassLoader loads files from their physical file locations e.g.
Filesystem, Network location etc.
There are three main types of ClassLoaders in Java.
1. Bootstrap ClassLoader: This is the first ClassLoader. It
loads classes from rt.jar file.
2. Extension ClassLoader: It loads class files from jre/lib/ext
location.
3. Application ClassLoader: This ClassLoader depends on
CLASSPATH to find the location of class files. If you
specify your jars in CLASSPATH, then this ClassLoader
will load them.
