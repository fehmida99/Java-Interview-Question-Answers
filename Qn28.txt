28. If there are no pointers in Java,
then why do we get
NullPointerException?
In Java, the pointer equivalent is Object reference. When we use a .
it points to object reference. So JVM uses pointers but
programmers only see object references.
In case an object reference points to null object, and we try to
access a method or member variable on it, then we get
NullPointerException.
