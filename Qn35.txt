35. Why do we mark main method as
static in Java?
The main method in Java is marked as static, so that JVM can call it
to start the program. If main method is not static, then which
constructor will be called by Java process?
As such it is a known as convention to mark main method static in
Java. But if we remove the static, then there will be ambiguity. Java
process may not know which method of a class to call to start the
program.
So this convention helps in Java process to identify the starting code
for a program in class that is passed as an argument to java process.
