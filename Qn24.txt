24. Why Java does not support
multiple inheritance?
Multiple Inheritance means that a class can inherit behavior from
two or more parent classes.
The issue with Multiple Inheritance is that both the parent classes
may have different implementation for the same method. So they
have different ways of doing the same thing. Now which
implementation should the child class choose?
This leads to ambiguity in Multiple Inheritance. This is the main
reason for Java not supporting Multiple Inheritance in
implementation.
Lets say you have a class TV and another class AtomBomb. Both
have method switchOn() but only TV has switchOff() method. If
your class inherits from both these classes then you have an issue
that you can switchOn() both parents, but switchOff will only
switchOff() TV.
But you can implement multiple interfaces in Java.
