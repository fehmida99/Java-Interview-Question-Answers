5. How Java platform is different
from other platforms?
Java is a platform independent language. Java compiler converts
Java code in to byte code that can be interpreted by JVM. There are
JVM written for almost all the popular platforms in the world.
Java byte code can run on any supported platform in same way.
Where as other languages require libraries compiled for a specific
platform to run.
