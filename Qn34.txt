34. What is the purpose of static
method in Java?
Java provides the feature of static method to create behavior at the
class level. The static method is common to all the objects of a
class. We do not need to create any object of a class to call a static
method. So it provides convenience of not creating an object for
calling it.
Also a static method can access and modify static data members.
This also helps in keeping the behavior as well as state at the class
level.
