20. Why constructors cannot be final,
static, or abstract in Java?
If we set a method as final it means we do not want any class to
override it. But the constructor (as per Java Language
Specification) cannot be overridden. So there is no use of marking it
final.
If we set a method as abstract it means that it has no body and it
should be implemented in a child class. But the constructor is called
implicitly when the new keyword is used. Therefore it needs a
body.
If we set a method as static it means that it belongs to the class, but
not a particular object. The constructor is always called to initialize
an object. Therefore, there is no use of marking constructor static.
